# Vehicle-routing-and-Inventory-Manag.-Project
Visualization of the store location clustering for vehicle routing using the 10,000-row dataset.

X-axis: Encoded store locations (e.g., East = 0, West = 1â€¦).
Y-axis: Demand at each store.
Colors: Represent different delivery clusters (zones) assigned by KMeans.

This graph helps plan efficient vehicle routing by grouping nearby stores with similar demand profiles.
